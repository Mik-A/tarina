Tarina

![Tarina Leone, one done & one in post processing stage](docs/tarina-leone.jpg)

A video camera that organizes takes, shots & scenes and glues your film together. 

Experience filmmaking flow
------------------------------
If you don't like how your [montage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_(filmmaking)) flows, retake. Once you "get it" thereâ€™s no need for editing. The camera is designed with a "hackers/makers philosophy" and is easy to take apart. It's built using the Raspberry Pi, running on a Gnu/Linux Raspbian distribution and with a python coded interface.

Hardware
--------
The parts are built around the world by different manufacturers. They've been chosen on the basis of features, quality, openness, availabilty and price. One of the central ideas of the project is to have a camera that could be upgraded or repaired by the fact that you easily just switch a component. The casis of the camera is all 3d printable with a design that has the key element of flipping the lens 180 (gonzo style). Here's the main components:
